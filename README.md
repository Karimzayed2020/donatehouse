# üëã donatehouse
Service for broadcasting donation events to 
[Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com) room. 

Used [clubhouse-py](https://github.com/stypr/clubhouse-py) and 
[Agora Python SDK](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Agora-Python-SDK).

Right now, this only works 
for [donation alerts](https://www.donationalerts.com/).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
**You use this service at your own risk and should understand 
that your account may be blocked.**

## Usage
You must have a verified account that has passed the procedure 
for joining the Clubhouse (via an invite).

To get started, create a Clubhouse account from your primary account.
